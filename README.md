A very basic, local library catalogue for use in my home library. Current ILS software is _way_ too extensive for simple home-library needs.
Other software (e.g. goodreads) are all online, I prefer to have a local-only solution.

Features:
-add books to 'database' (currently a .csv file)
-search owned books
-view list of books

Currently command line/terminal-only. 

Todo:
-delete books from collection
-book ratings
-mark as read/not read
-suggest random unread book
-frontend rather than CLI, e.g. server (flask?)
-book illustrations (if front-end implemented).
